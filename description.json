Seminar\",\"description\":\"A Journey From First Rehearsal to Final Performance<br/><br/>This freshman seminar is designed for the general campus student. The course is designed to provide opportunities for music aficionados to experience music and music theater events from the inside-out. The only prerequisite for the course is a love of the performing arts! You do NOT have to read, perform, or understand music notation to succeed in this course. However, you have to be prepared to spend a lot of time attending rehearsals and concerts (minimally six hours a week), outside of the two required class sessions.<br/><br/>Inside and outside of classroom sessions, the instructor and invited guests will attempt to nurture a heightened awareness of the challenges that conductors, opera and music theater directors and musicians/actors face when preparing for a performance. Through a series of observations, presentations, interviews, and interactive discussions/seminars, you will be better prepared to listen, observe, and critically analyze performing arts events on and off campus - during this academic quarter, and hopefully for the rest of your life.<br/><br/>After Week One's introduction to the course and the music library, the Week Two class sessions will concentrate on conducting lessons and video observations of concerts and rehearsals. In these initial sessions, you will learn many of the techniques needed to lead the world's greatest instrumental and choral ensembles (of course, with many additional years of practice). Course participants, using their required conductor's baton and music CD's will learn a variety of conducting techniques - mastering beat patterns, the expressive use of the left hand, and using the conducting gesture to communicate &quot;interpretation,&quot; &quot;phrasing,&quot; and &quot;dynamic shading.&quot; You may never conduct a major ensemble, but after meeting the requirements of the class you should have the knowledge and understanding to critically analyze conductors during your future career as a member of audiences for classical and popular music concerts.\"}",

The goals are to expand our skills as listeners, to consider diverse scholarly approaches to music, and in the process, reconsider the social roles music can play in culture.  Some of these roles include music as ritual, as a mode of communication, and of course, as artistic expression. To achieve these goals, we will consider the local contexts of music from many regions, while examining ways that these traditions respond to forces of globalization.

These questions will be explored through a variety of topics such as: vocal and instrumental performance in western art music; social processes of teaching and learning (in schools, in folk tradition, and in adolescent bands); masculinities in rock, hip-hop, and reggaeton; and feminisms in alternative and popular music.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"32810\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"MUSIC\",\"subject\":\"GEN_MUS\",\"course\":\"230-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"History of Opera\",\"description\":\"Since its invention at the turn of the 17th century, opera has earned a reputation as the most extravagant of staged musical entertainments.

What is the subject of music-historical narratives - works, composers, styles, genres, practices, ideas? Should history deal with how works are created or their impact on human culture, or both? How have scholars and writers outside the musicological community written about music? How do they integrate music and musical issues into broader historical narratives? How do films about past eras that foreground the music of those eras deal with issues like authenticity, verisimilitude, and audience expectations? <br/><br/>After discussing these issues in the abstract, we will see how music embodies history in three artistic spheres - opera, film, and the novel - by focusing on four case studies: Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Stravinsky and Auden's The Rake's Progress, Bernard Rose's film Immortal Beloved, and Thomas Mann's novel Doctor Faustus<br/>Active class participation and an extended term project will be expected of all students.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"32930\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"MUSIC\",\"subject\":\"MUSICOL\",\"course\":\"435-0\",\"section\":\"21\",\"title\":\"Selected Topics in Musicology\",\"description\":\"Contact the department for further information\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"32927\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"MUSIC\",\"subject\":\"MUSICOL\",\"course\":\"435-0\",\"section\":\"22\",\"title\":\"Selected Topics in Musicology\",\"description\":\"<i>Opera Since 1900</i><br/> <br/>When opera entered the 20th century, it had to face the legacy of Verdi and Wagner, the new currents of modernism, and the rise of cinema and other mass media entertainments, among other challenges.

Students are required to complete substantial programming assignments.<br/><br/><br/>We begin the course by installing the Java software (JDK and JRE), and discussing the Java architecture.  Our first lectures cover Java variable declaration and initialization, and basic input/output.  From there we move on to Java conditional statements (if, if else, if else if, and switch).  Next, we cover the iterations available in Java: while, do while and for.  We conclude the course by covering the basics of arrays, a GUI interface and objects. Typically, course assignments include four open-book quizzes and six programming asssignments.  The programming assignments usually include at least four indiviudual programs.  The final programming assignment covers the entire course and is a program you can design yourself.

Gladwell calls this idea &quot;the power of thinking without thinking,&quot; and uses it to explain an astonishing variety of events, such as how an art museum paid $10 million for an obvious fake, how America elected its worst president (probably not the one you think), and why New York City police officers fired 41 bullets at an unarmed man. Instead of accepting or rejecting Gladwell's basic argument, this course uses the book as a starting point to dive into some of the provocative topics and people the book describes - among them gamblers, art forgers, musicians, firefighters, athletes, soldiers, marriage counselors, and ordinary single people looking for a mate.<br/><br/>English 111 is a course in academic writing, and its purpose is mostly to prepare you to succeed in SCS or any other academic program where writing is important.

My aim is to help you develop skills you can apply to any writing task, academic or not.  Writers need something to write about, and in this course we'll use Malcolm Gladwell's 2005 bestseller Blink as the basis for our work (partly because it's interesting, partly because it's an example of good writing).  We will start by reading and writing about the book itself, and in the second half of the course students will pursue their own research and writing projects on topics related to the book's themes.

Samuel Beckett made a career out of being lost!  Aporia is a figure of speech, meant to describe the failure of rhetoric to solve a contradiction of meaning.  I think there is a kind of aporia that has to do with subject matter, too-that of unspeakable trauma (the Holocaust, terminal illness, childhood abuse)-giving the survivor no straightforward way to convey that experience.  What literary strategies are available to writers looking to convey experience with such a lack of words and thoughts?  How can writers of fiction and essays find a narrative for profoundly awful events?

These images - including images of savage Africa, noble Africa, suffering Africa, and primitive Africa - served Western intellectuals in their discussions of the ideas of &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;civilization.&quot;  Although slavery and colonialism no longer exist, these images have nevertheless continued to be remade, in new variants, by successive generations of novelists, political theorists, journalists, and filmmakers.

The second part of the course examines how U.S.-Latin American relations have (and have not) changed since the end of the Cold War, a period during which U.S. involvement and interest in the region has, in general, declined.  Key issues explored during this half of the course include the rise of &quot;soft&quot; intervention, the war on drugs, economic integration, and immigration.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"32922\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"SCS\",\"subject\":\"POLI_SCI\",\"course\":\"390-CN\",\"section\":\"14\",\"title\":\"Special Topics\",\"description\":\"This course will focus on American Wars from Vietnam to Afghanistan.  In particular we will examine how these wars ended, whether the goals of each were reached and whether those goals were realistic in the first place. This approach varies from that normally utilized in the study of these wars, but it retroactively will illuminate some failures in the overall strategy.  Topics will include state building, counter terrorism versus counter insurgency, assassination as a tactic (drones) and the role of air power (also drones).

Through its Open Chicago initiative (http://chicagoinspectorgeneral.org/major-initiatives/open-chicago/), the IGO will be working with students from Northwestern University to enhance transparency within the city of Chicago government. The Open Chicago initiative is designed to increase the understanding of city government for all stakeholders - city residents, the media, even members of the City Council - and to promote efficiency, effectiveness and integrity in the city's operations that can come only from accountability achieved through meaningful public scrutiny. <br/><br/>A list of projects will be offered so that students, working in teams of 3-4, will have an opportunity to select an assignment which they find to be of most interest to them. These are not abstract exercises, but rather opportunities to make realistic and pragmatic contributions to improve our political process and enhance access to city government. Students will work primarily in an online environment in cooperation with IGO staff and according to each student's availability and schedule, as well as attend the weekly lecture seminar. <br/><br/>Each student will be evaluated based on the quality of their effort in the selected assignment and a grade given based on the rubrics for that project. Students will utilize metrics to analyze the level of transparency in the city department selected for their project by researching what information the city of Chicago publishes on its website, how information about public meetings is transmitted to city residents, and accessibility of city government to residents. In addition students will review other municipal governments by researching transparency and engagement activities of those municipalities to determine what the current best practices are in these areas.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"33064\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"SCS\",\"subject\":\"PREDICT\",\"course\":\"401-DL\",\"section\":\"55\",\"title\":\"Introduction to Statistical

How does one gain access to an inner-city community or to a prison or to a group of gay students? How does one confirm what you've heard? How do you establish empathy?

In each case, investigative reporting has played a key role, and over the years, it has proven to be one of the highest forms of journalism: shedding light on wrongdoing, exposing corruption at the highest levels and taking on powerful people and institutions that have abused their power and the disenfranchised. In this course, we will focus on an important facet of journalism: investigating potentially wrongful convictions. This class isn't about theory; it's about pursuing the truth about real murder cases, interviewing skittish sources in often tough neighborhoods and prisoners serving time, sometimes decades, for crimes they say they didn't commit. Students will be introduced to a variety of investigative techniques, interviewing skills, approaches to developing sources and employing public documents and databases. Of paramount importance in this class: student safety and adhering to the highest ethical standards in journalism. Students are expected to devote a tremendous amount of time in the field, weekdays and weekends, doing real shoe-leather journalism, knocking on doors, digging for information and determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. Students will be assisted by a veteran private investigator in the class and in the field. Keep in mind: Investigative reporting is hard. Expect to confront roadblocks. Anticipate spinning your wheels. There will be frustrations and setbacks. And along the way, hopefully, you will learn to think like an investigative reporter, you will learn by doing and you will do it by the most honorable methods and, so, come closer to discovering the truth.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"31054\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"JOUR\",\"subject\":\"JOUR\",\"course\":\"376-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Media Design\",\"description\":\"This is an undergraduate class that explores the fundamental tools of design, typographic contrast and color theory.

Using the journalist's toolbox - research, interviews and computer-assisted reporting - students will tell the real stories and illuminate problems facing urban families, teachers, administrators and policy makers.<br/> <br/>The course will require lots of field work - in the schools, district headquarters, parents' homes - as well as rigorous analysis of school data like the Illinois State School Report Card, individual student assessment scores and various information from federal and local sources. The class will learn to use Microsoft Excel, and potentially advanced statistical software like SPSS, to perform precision data analysis. <br/> <br/>Students will then work on taking that analysis and research and turning it into compelling stories and essays for the general public, policy makers and education advocates. The goal is to produce publishable stories or op-ed pieces that could appear in newspapers, magazines and education policy journals. There will also be opportunities to publish the best of these pieces on Medill's Website &quot;The Chicago Bureau: Examining Global Issues Vital to Today's Youth.&quot;<br/><br/>Prof. Little is a former Chicago Tribune database reporter primarily focused on urban affairs issues, including demographics, education and housing.

However, one cannot avoid discussing economics and technology while exploring the cultural/communicative dimensions of globalization. The course will explore topics such as: diaspora, hybrid identities, time-space compression, ethnic and religious conflict, the emergence of NGOs (non-governmental organization), the decline of nation-states, global media, the network society, the anti-Americanism, and global terrorism.  These topics and events alert us to the critical importance of culture and communication in understanding the globalized world, full of promises and conflicts, in which we live today.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"23519\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"SoC\",\"subject\":\"COMM_ST\",\"course\":\"394-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Communication Studies Research Seminar\",\"description\":\"Do people become more connected because they are going online?

This course aims to introduce students to fundamental questions about the implications of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for communication, interpersonal relationships, and social interaction. This course will focus on various topics in the new media and communication studies including how ICTs afford communication, forms of online communication, identity and impression management in digital spaces, online social networks, as well as relationship development and maintenance in online contexts.<br/><br/>This course has three major objectives. The first is to understand how communication technologies condition interpersonal communication and social interaction. The second is to compare and criticize the major scholarly perspectives regarding this phenomenon. The third is to improve and refine your writing skills as they are applied to a 20-page research paper.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"23520\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"SoC\",\"subject\":\"COMM_ST\",\"course\":\"394-0\",\"section\":\"21\",\"title\":\"Communication Studies Research Seminar\",\"description\":\"As a culture, we are saturated with media representations of women, which function as agents of socialization and provide us with visual and textual cues meant to define what it means to be female in America.

More than simply an institution for educating young Americans about a range of different topics, high school in the United States is also a highly complex social and cultural institution through which nearly all Americans circulate.  As such, it plays a central role in preparing adolescents for national citizenship and promotes intense feelings of anxiety, nostalgia, and even shame among those required to submit themselves to its discipline. We will investigate the nature of the connection between this kind of affective response and the fact that, because high school in the U. S. is neither uniform nor unified and constituted at the same time by a range of practices at once official and highly informal, it also differentiates among the young people it addresses. Through an analysis of the history, culture, and social and political effects of high school, we will consider how this institution functions as a social sorting mechanism and how it produces, reproduces and maintains a highly differentiated society with the aid of public culture and the mass media.  Some of the topics we will discuss include the economic conditions of possibility for high school; the nature of the official and unofficial curriculum; the role of extra-curricular activities including clubs, athletics, and social activities; and the role of friendship, cliques, and social networks in the organization of activities surrounding gender presentation and intimate social relations.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"29632\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"SoC\",\"subject\":\"COMM_ST\",\"course\":\"525-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Seminar-Problems in Comm Studies\",\"description\":\"Contact the department for further information\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"29656\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"SoC\",\"subject\":\"COMM_ST\",\"course\":\"525-0\",\"section\":\"21\",\"title\":\"Seminar-Problems in Comm Studies\",\"description\":\"What is a rhetorical performance? How can an emphasis on performance enrich rhetorical analysis? Are rhetorical and performative analyses distinct, cognate, or identical? In this course we seek to theorize performance for rhetorical studies, highlighting a traditional subject, the public oration in the Western world.<br/><br/>Rhetorical analysis is sometimes distinguished from modes of inquiry such as literary criticism by an emphasis on an embodied, public art in which speakers and audiences mutually contribute to making meaning. This course proceeds from two assumptions: rhetorical scholars have special insights to contribute to theories of performance, and we can benefit from a careful reading of the work of scholars studying performance in other disciplines. To that end, we will trace the development of theories of oratorical delivery through classical and modern texts, we will investigate theories of performances from scholars in performance studies, theater, and history, and we will practice critical analysis of rhetoric in performance. Owing to the instructor's interests and expertise, a substantial component of the course will involve oratorical performance in the nineteenth-century United States.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"33539\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"SoC\",\"subject\":\"COMM_ST\",\"course\":\"525-0\",\"section\":\"22\",\"title\":\"Seminar-Problems in Comm Studies\",\"description\":\"Contact the department for further information\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"29741\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"SoC\",\"subject\":\"COMM_ST\",\"course\":\"525-0\",\"section\":\"25\",\"title\":\"Seminar-Problems in Comm Studies\",\"description\":\"This class explores the recent interventions made in &quot;crip,&quot; queer, and transgender studies in conceptualizing the &quot;body.&quot; We will alternatively consider the body as an event, a discursive object, a performance, and a site for production and interrogate the body's ongoing relevance to the field of communication.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"29818\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"SoC\",\"subject\":\"COMM_ST\",\"course\":\"525-0\",\"section\":\"26\",\"title\":\"Seminar-Problems in Comm Studies\",\"description\":\"This course introduces graduate students to qualitative and archival research methodologies for the study of media culture.

In Jump Rhythm we explore &quot;full-bodied rhythm making&quot; - learning how to transform the naturally moving body into a rhythm-accurate, emotionally expressive percussion instrument.  All dancing is primarily learned by expressing rhythmic energy rather than position-to-position shape.  That is, it is primarily learned by expressing the rhythmic and emotional energy one generates from within oneself rather than the steps or shapes one learns through visual imitation. The principal articulators of this energy are the &quot;four primary drumbeaters of the body&quot; - the hands, head, and voice.  Since these drumbeaters are also the primary communicators of feeling in human beings, the technique also helps students of acting, music theatre, and all other voice and movement arts refine their gestural expressivity.  Being rhythm-driven, Jump Rhythm's exercises, communal improvisations, and group choreography are performed to the music of one's own rhythmic vocalizing as well as to African-American-originated musical forms like the blues, swinging jazz, funk, and hip-hop.  Finally, all dancing is built upon the movement-efficient, injury-preventive postural base called Standing Down Straight®.  Standing Down Straight promotes both physical and mental grounding by connecting one's body to the ground, to the self, and to the community of people with whom one takes class.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"23500\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"SoC\",\"subject\":\"DANCE\",\"course\":\"270-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Ballet II\",\"description\":\"This intermediate technique class focuses on improving alignment, building strength, and increasing whole body awareness and dexterity within and through the codified exercises and enchainment of classical ballet.

The primary course objectives will be: (1) to broaden students understanding of performance and performativity and their role in the production of social and cultural orders, (2) to understand key theories of the relationship between performance and legal and/or political social orders, (3) to understand the effect that performance may have in instigating and realizing political and legal transformation.  Students will study texts/sites that range from activist interventions, state rituals (such as investiture or the state funeral), courtroom proceedings, dramatic representations of legal and political ritual, legal cases, and keys works of political theory and performance theory.

In this course we will interrogate the relationship of performance to Marxism as well as the place of Marxism in Performance Studies. Inversely, we will study the impact and influence of Marxism upon modern and contemporary performance forms.

Therefore, we will concentrate on the doing of fieldwork both as a theoretical examination AND as practical application in the critical engagement with Others within specific environments and locations. We will consider various fieldwork methods as our theoretical inquiries help us reflect upon the meanings and purposes of ethnographic praxis or critical ethnography. <br/> Because critical ethnography concerns the rhetorical, ethical, and political effects of what we DO,  performance is a fundamental dynamic in this seminar. We will explore performance as theory, method, event, and everyday occurrence. We will examine the interpenetrating relationships among performance, ethnography, economy, and culture. Since culture is made visible to us through its representations, e.g., its structures, dramas, symbols, metaphors, habits, everyday practices, landscapes, language patterns, etc.,performance becomes those embodied enactments formed by and embedded within these representations, as it simultaneously generates them. Performance becomes a primary point of entry and inquiry where we may be/act, see/hear, feel/sense, and think/evaluate within an Other world and our own.  We will examine the fieldwork experiences of selected ethnographers through a &quot;performance lens&quot; -merging theory and practice as we &quot;travel&quot; to the &quot;worlds&quot; of Others.  The aim of the seminar, therefore, is to learn more about what is at stake critically and methodologically from a performance perspective when you begin to &quot;travel across worlds.&quot;\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"23548\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"SoC\",\"subject\":\"RTVF\",\"course\":\"190-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Media Construction\",\"description\":\"Students will be introduced to the technical and theoretical components necessary for media construction: narrative, sound, image, and editing.

Survivor was imported to the United States in the spring of 2000 and quickly became one of America's most-watched and talked about television programs. The show's runaway success propelled the CBS network to the top of the Nielsen ratings and transformed producer Mark Burnett into one of television's most sought-after talents. It also launched the current reality TV boom, inspiring a host of programs that emulated Survivor's competition format, episodic structure, and visual style. While most of these programs have long since had their torches snuffed, Survivor has outwitted, outlasted, and outplayed its competition for twenty-three seasons.

The title is chosen and derives from the presupposition that many do not understand the significance of race in our society, and that students at this university would benefit a heightened awareness of such facts.  Despite the ambiguity regarding what race is and what it does to our social world, one would be hard pressed to find a condition, or a category of difference, that has done more to undermine the idea of democracy and universal justice.  The very idea of nation states, inpart, originated from mythologies of racial or ethnic uniformity as race was deployed as an element that bound persons together within discourses of citizenship and belonging.  In a nation like the U.S., race was made a foundational prerequisite for citizenship from the outset, as white supremacy was instilled as a distinct characteristic of the development and evolution of this settler colonial society.  In addition, the U.S. achieved its racial/ethnic pluralism not through, as its mythology purports, its unquenchable thirst for diversity and embracement of the &quot;huddled masses&quot; of the world, but through acts of systemic and state sanctioned violence towards persons who were categorized and discursively consented to as &quot;non-white.&quot; <br/>Such important facts are routinely glossed over by mythologies regarding our past.  In the current moment, illuminating the social meaning of race is often an even more difficult task in so much as there exists a popular perception that we are now in a &quot;post-racial&quot; or &quot;post-civil rights&quot; society.  The meaning associated with those terms is that, upon being effectively pressured by heroic civil rights activists in the 1950s and 1960s, the state has now done all that it can possibly do to eradicate barriers to universal justice.  As a result, rather than looking at structural, institutional, or historical phenomena, there exists a popular tendency to scrutinize the culture, beliefs, and even innate characteristics of groups like Blacks and Latinos when attempting to decipher why it is that they represent the two most impoverished, under-educated, politically under-represented, incarcerated, racially profiled, police brutalized, and environmentally sickened populations in the U.S.  <br/>By contrast, to understand such conditions requires a critical understanding of histories of anti-Black and anti-Latino racism in the U.S.  In addition, in this day and age, anti-racist critiques are commonly criminalized as more the source of racial divisions in our society than a reflection of them and their historical roots.  Such discursive maneuvers often take place through terms such as &quot;playing the race card,&quot; a saying that suggests that any mention of race is comparable to one violating the rules of absolute fair play and generating racial tensions.  And yet, the history of the U.S. suggests to us that competitions over access to resources and representation have never been quite fair as they apply to non-white peoples.  <br/>Bearing all of these dilemmas in mind, the primary goal for this course is to instill within future leaders, a more critical awareness of how race has and continues to undermine both the promise and premise of universal justice.  There is no doubt, that it often determines the neighborhoods in which we live, the jobs open to us, the kinds of education we receive, the kinds of health care that we find accessible, the relationships we have with agents of law enforcement, our reproductive rights, our accessibility to justice in courts of law, and even the quality of air that we breathe.  While the experiences of all racial and ethnic groups will be examined, this course will focus primarily on the history and plights of nation's two largest minority groups, African Americans and Latinos.  Lastly, our scrutiny of the social meaning of race will always already be associated with an awareness of how race works in union with gender, sexuality, and class to structure lives, identities, and relations of power on a local, national, and global scale.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"31467\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"AF_AM_ST\",\"course\":\"330-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Black Women in the 20Th Century\",\"description\":\"Contact the department for further information\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"31468\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"AF_AM_ST\",\"course\":\"365-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Black Chicago\",\"description\":\"Contact the department for further information\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"21911\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"AF_AM_ST\",\"course\":\"380-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Topics in African-American Studies\",\"description\":\"Contact the department for further information\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"21493\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"AF_AM_ST\",\"course\":\"396-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Internship in African-American Studies\",\"description\":\"Contact the department for further information\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"31643\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"AF_AM_ST\",\"course\":\"420-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Expressive Arts and Cultural Studies\",\"description\":\"Contact the department for further information\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"31469\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"AF_AM_ST\",\"course\":\"445-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Historicizing Race in Latin America\",\"description\":\"Contact the department for further information\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"31470\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"AF_AM_ST\",\"course\":\"480-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Graduate Topics in African American Studies\",\"description\":\"Contact the department for further information\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"22708\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"AF_AM_ST\",\"course\":\"480-0\",\"section\":\"22\",\"title\":\"Graduate Topics in African American Studies\",\"description\":\"In this graduate seminar, students will develop an in-depth understanding of the scope of poverty in America and consider competing theories on its causes.

What is the relationship between the vigilante and the state, and in what ways has the state benefitted from vigilantism? Where can we draw distinctions between vigilantism, terrorism, and rebellion? How has the vigilante contributed to nation-building?

As such, it plays a central role in preparing adolescents for national citizenship and promotes intense feelings of anxiety, nostalgia, and even shame among those required to submit themselves to its discipline. We will investigate the nature of the connection between this kind of affective response and the fact that, because high school in the U. S. is neither uniform nor unified and constituted at the same time by a range of practices at once official and highly informal, it also differentiates among the young people it addresses. Through an analysis of the history, culture, and social and political effects of high school, we will consider how this institution functions as a social sorting mechanism and how it produces, reproduces and maintains a highly differentiated society with the aid of public culture and the mass media.  Some of the topics we will discuss include the economic conditions of possibility for high school; the nature of the official and unofficial curriculum; the role of extra-curricular activities including clubs, athletics, and social activities; and the role of friendship, cliques, and social networks in the organization of activities surrounding gender presentation and intimate social relations.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"21037\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"AMER_ST\",\"course\":\"390-2\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Senior Project\",\"description\":\"A year-long sequence to complete a thesis or field study required of majors.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"32131\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"AMES\",\"course\":\"271-1\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Japanese Literature in Translation\",\"description\":\"Between 300 and 1000 A.D.

Students will design and carry out a local field work project.  The topic should be one that can lend itself to the methods at hand (open ended interviews, ethnosemantic analysis, participant observation, survey construction and analysis, etc.), and it should seek to build on, and develop, a theoretical question in anthropology.  Each week will entail some reading and a small field assignment tailored to the project.  Class time will be devoted to comparing methods as well as problems encountered during the week.  The last assignment will be a write up of the project in a short paper.  The best social science involves a combination of rigor and innovative thinking in integrating theory and methods of many sorts.  A number of other courses available in the university provide training in quantitative methods and hypothesis testing.  This one focuses on &quot;qualitative&quot; methods, though the approach to deriving credible explanations of behavior is generic to inquiry in general.  We will be concerned with: 1) the distinguishing cultural characteristics of phenomena, 2) innovation and improvisation for adapting conventional methods to the specific problem at hand, 3) the often underutilized &quot;native's wisdom&quot; during both data collection and data analysis, 4) &quot;iterative&quot; efforts to derive, refine, and modify research questions, stretching them well beyond the initial proposal, rather than simply testing one hypothesis, and 5) &quot;squeezing the evidence&quot; (Carlo Ginzburg): wresting as much information as possible, especially by probing, irrespective of the method at hand.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"31504\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"ANTHRO\",\"course\":\"390-0\",\"section\":\"21\",\"title\":\"Topics In Anthropology\",\"description\":\"This seminar will address the interplay between family ties and individually defined vital events (birth, marriage, death, migration) among African families whose members move and live between Africa and another continent:  especially Europe.

The course will approach Russian and Soviet culture as a distinct model of modernity, both sharing and departing from more familiar Western models of modernism. Russian artists were among the first to invent abstraction in the 1910s, and, after the 1917 Revolution, to insist on a utilitarian function for art in relation to everyday life and social needs. They also invented Socialist Realism, otherwise known as &quot;totalitarian art.&quot; We will begin by examining late19th-century Russian traditions of realism and Impressionism, and then address such modernist movements as Neo-primitivism, Cubo-futurism, Suprematism, Constructivism, photomontage, and photography, as well as the parallel development of a modern form of realism in the 1920s, culminating in the invention, in the early 1930s, of Socialist Realism as an alternate model of modern art.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"22033\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"ART_HIST\",\"course\":\"390-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Undergraduate Seminar\",\"description\":\"Contact the department for further information\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"21781\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"ART_HIST\",\"course\":\"391-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Undergraduate Methods Seminar\",\"description\":\"This seminar offers undergraduate Art History majors an opportunity to survey, assess, and deploy principal methods of the discipline, in order to familiarize themselves with the critical tools of our trade and to hone their skills as young scholars.

Despite the richness of the history of American sculpture, to date the medium has received wildly uneven treatment depending on the historical period, style, or artistic movement one is studying. While there is a great deal of writing, for example, on colonial New England gravestones, on the antebellum Greek Slave of Hiram Powers, and on minimalism, sculpture is considerably less present in conceptualizations of and scholarly work on other topics/times. This seminar is conceived to compensate for that lack of attention and to challenge the way in which other mediumsin particular paintingorganize, or even dominate, our understandings of American art and its histories. At the same time, the course calls into question the value of making strict divisions between artistic mediums. For the purposes of this seminar, both &quot;American&quot; and &quot;sculpture&quot; are considered permeable and defined broadly.

Reaching back to the earliest encounters of Asians with the Americas, we will discuss how European imperialism and American expansionism shaped those encounters into a history that is often closer in nature to the forced migration of Africans as slaves than to the migration of European settlers. We will examine the ways in which images such as the Yellow Peril and the Model Minority have concrete impact on the lived experience of Asian immigrants and Asian Americans, and explore their significance in American discourse on race and racial difference. The significance of race and ethnicity, class, and gender in the ongoing creation of the American nation and Asian American communities will be important leitmotifs throughout this course.

We then focus on WWII as a crucible of new racial and economic dynamics that differentially locate Blacks and Asians in the post-war economy, including the entrance of second wave Asian immigrants following the Immigration Act of 1965 and the impact of 1970s deindustrialization on urban America.  We turn to analyze contemporary theories of race and identity beyond Black and White to reconceptualize inter-minority relations and examine the burgeoning racial consciousness of the 1960s.  Following a section on the Third World internationalism of Black and Asian leaders (e.g., W.E.B. du Bois and Mao Tse-tung) and the overlapping Civil Rights, Black Power, and Asian American movements, we analyze stereotypes (such as the model minority myth) used to pit Asians and Blacks against one another.

At its core, the goal of genomics is to generate a detailed map of an organism's genome that includes the location and identity of every gene. However, the field of genomics is becoming increasingly broad, often focusing on the questions and analyses that arise once a genome has been sequenced and described. The methods developed by the Human Genome Project, both from a sequencing and analysis perspective, significantly altered the landscape of human research, both from a biomedical and from an evolutionary standpoint. Building on these methods and on very recent advances in DNA sequencing technology, genomics is no longer limited to the study of humans; genome research can now being applied to any organism from jellyfish to polar bear, from mold to palm trees. In this class we will discuss how an why we sequence genomes, how we analyze their content, and how the understanding of genomes from across the entire tree of life (i.e., comparative genomics) can illuminate fundamental questions in biology.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"31996\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"BIOL_SCI\",\"course\":\"390-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Molecular Biology\",\"description\":\"This is a course designed for upper level undergraduate students.

The world is fraught with risk, but fortunately, there are a variety of approaches that allow firms - and by extension, households, governments and other organizations - to identify and measure risk, and then use cost-benefit analysis to determine how to best manage it through avoidance, transfer, limited exposure, or impact reduction.<br/>General goals pursued throughout this course are to:<br/>-Stimulate your interest in risk management as a means of improving your decisions.<br/>-Familiarize you with media jargon to enhance your ability to follow the news.<br/>-Practice writing and speaking about current events from an economics perspective.<br/>-Develop your economic literacy by using our tools of analysis (graphs, algebra, equilibrium, constrained optimization, comparative statics).<br/>-Deepen your understanding of the roles of government and markets in reducing various risks.<br/>-Prepare you for post-Northwestern life by enabling you to manage risk in your future potential roles as a consumer, producer, job seeker, citizen, parent, investor, etc.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"21331\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"BUS_INST\",\"course\":\"394-0\",\"section\":\"21\",\"title\":\"Professional Linkage Seminar\",\"description\":\"Sports Marketing in the 21st Century is a &quot;foundation&quot; course, designed to provide students with a comprehensive and broad understanding of the discipline of Sports Marketing and the overall Business Dynamics of the Sports Industry.   <br/><br/>The sports and sponsorship marketing industry has exhibited explosive growth worldwide since the early 1980's.  This growth has showed no signs of letup. Sports Marketing in the 21st Century  will demonstrate the clear-cut evolution of &quot;Sports Marketing&quot; and &quot;Sponsorship&quot;, the growth engine of Sports Marketing.

There has been a stock market crash, an economic boom that lasted an unprecedented ten years, irrational exuberance, insider trading scandals, accounting scandals, wars, and the current developing issues with respect to executives being brought to trial.

From the 1790s until the middle of the twentieth century, Western feminism fought on two fronts, condemning women's legal and political disenfranchisement as well as practices, like the wearing of corsets, that subordinated women at the level of everyday life.  GSS 231/ CLS 205 will explore feminism in America after the legal and political battle has, to some extent, been won.  We'll examine the so-called second wave of feminism, from the mid-1960s to the end of the 1970s.  This radical, widespread, and intimately critical phase of the feminist movement attacked inequity that persisted beyond women's nominal political and legal enfranchisement.  The second wave locates oppression in personal lifein intercourse, domestic labor, fashion, representation, art, family, and loveto assert that mainstream norms, habits, and assumptions operate just as powerfully as repressive laws.  Because much second-wave feminist argument exists in the forms of physical activism, cultural interventions, and artistic production, we will encounter a variety of media: academic prose, but also manifestos, journalism, film, visual art, video art, novels, and performances.  At the same time that we track the historical roots and articulations of this feminist movement, an ongoing goal of the class will be to investigate the critical methods pioneered by the second wave.  What analytic tools does second-wave feminism use to criticize culture?

Young Jewish men are afforded a glimpse of the intellectual vistas lying beyond the stifling confines of the traditional Jewish shtetl.  Reviled in these traditional communities as &quot;heretics&quot; they sought refuge from ostracism, persecution, in the tenements and boarding-houses of the metropolises of Europe. Umbilically attached to an unspoken language these outsiders wrote in full awareness that their potential audience consisted largely of each other. This &quot;imagined community&quot; was an exclusively male domain; the handful of female Hebrew writers in the Europe constituted an absolute anomaly. <br/>It was in the erotic realm that this isolation reached its fullest literary summation, especially in the figure of the &quot;Talush&quot; (&quot;the uprooted man&quot;) which placed center stage effeminate, masochistic Jewish men often subordinated by ruthless gentile women. This literature breathed of sexual anxiety: masturbation, homo-erotic ideation, traumatic encounters with prostitutes, narcissism, sado-masochism are openly addressed.<br/>The course aims to explore the poetic, the ideological and the gender implementations of the tension between eros and isolation in turn-of-the century Hebrew literature. At the same time, we would investigate the manners in which themes of eros and isolation later pervaded Modern Hebrew literature after the move to the land of Israel and the establishment of the state of Israel. Has the rebuilding of the national &quot;Home&quot; brought the uprooted man his long lost masculinity?

This course surveys cross-cultural exchanges and dramatic conflicts between U.S. and Latin American poets in the &quot;Global Cold War&quot; (1945-1989). We often describe the Cold War as a political conflict between the competing universals of American democracy and Soviet communism, but the Cold War also re-oriented cultural relations between the U.S. and Latin America. How did poets from the U.S. and Cuba diverge in their reactions to (and participation in) the Cuban Revolution? How do Elizabeth Bishop's formalist poems of life in Brazil compare to those of her Brazilian contemporaries? Why did Beat poetry find a strong reception in Mexico City? How did Chilean poets write about the traumas of U.S.-backed interventions? Why did U.S. countercultures style themselves after &quot;revolutionary&quot; poets of Peru and El Salvador? Why did Borges, Paz and Neruda become sudden, global stars? We trace these questions through the history of &quot;late modernist&quot; poetry, Beat poetry, the Black Arts Movement, confessionalism, and formalism, putting these movements in dialogue with their cross-cultural doubles, such as conversacionalismo, concrete poetry, anti-poetry, &quot;guerilla&quot; poetry and negritude.

The questions we seek to answer are the following: What does it mean to be Chinese in the modern and contemporary era? Should the experience of Chineseness be defined in terms of Han ethnicity, citizenship, cultural and linguistic consent, or is it a matter of a shared collective experience? Moreover, how have sociopolitical forces within and outside of mainland China impacted the writing of Chineseness among writers of Han and non-Han descent? As we tackle these questions, we will study works by canonical writers of the pre-1949 era such as Lu Xun and Lao She as well as contemporary mainland Chinese masters such as Mo Yan, Han Shaogong and Yu Hua. In addition, we will supplement our reading by studying works by ethnic Chinese writers who have sojourned or settled permanently outside of traditional Chinese territories. In the process we will seek to examine the writing of Chineseness beyond the familiar framework of the nation-state and instead probe alternative models and competing claims of identification..

We will focus chiefly on ideas from A Thousand Plateaus that, since the book's publication in 1980, have &quot;gone viral,&quot; such as the concepts of the plateau, the rhizome, assemblage, deterritorialization, virtuality, the body without organs, becoming (becoming-woman, -animal, -minoritarian, -imperceptible, etc.), and nomadism.

Informally, economics helps us understand how decision makers (individually, in firms, and in public policy roles) respond to incentives; the importance of proper-functioning markets in a modern capitalist economy; and the role of formal and informal institutions/rules in those market processes. Microeconomics focuses on individual decisions (typically using cost-benefit analysis) and the inner workings of specific markets. This course introduces the principles of microeconomics and shows how to apply these concepts to real world settings. Thus, this course is aimed not only at potential economics majors, but also at any student who wants to develop an ability to understand the popular press, analyze government policies critically, and use microeconomics to make better choices as a consumer, producer, representative, or voter.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"21027\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"ECON\",\"course\":\"202-0\",\"section\":\"70\",\"title\":\"Introduction to Microeconomics\",\"description\":\"The majority of the course covers the principles of decision-making by households and firms and their interaction in markets.

This course will use economic methods to analyze these changes and help explain the observed gender differences in employment and earnings.  An economic framework will be developed to explain how individuals make rational decisions about the allocation of time between the household and the labor market.  The consequences of these decisions on family structure will be discussed. <br/><br/>Some specific areas of study include: occupational segregation, pre-market and labor market discrimination, feminization of poverty, and economic returns to education (gender differences).

How is inflation related to economic fluctuations?

Previously, legal study had focused on individual cases, considered issues of equity, and was thus backward looking-who should win a particular case narrowly considered? Given that every court case concerns past events that cannot now be changed, issues of efficiency seemed absent. Cases were categorized into cells-criminal, contracts, antitrust, and so on. Understanding the law categorized in one cell did little to help understand another cell. In brief, traditional legal study was filled with data (cases) for which it had no generally agreed explanatory model. <br/>In contrast, law &amp; economics begins with the usual economic assumption that rational actors maximize utility subject to constraint-market constraints (as in most economics courses) but also legal constraints regarding permitted and forbidden behavior. L&amp;E is forward looking-in the case at bar, how (if at all) will ruling for one litigant affect behavior of potential future litigants who are not in the courtroom and cannot even be identified at present, indeed, who may still be unborn? Many important choices are yet to be made by those parties, so efficiency issues loom large. The wealth of legal data (cases) can then be used to test the model. A similar perspective can be applied to statutory law, and even to informal societal norms. The distinct cells of traditional legal study become special cases of the application of a single unifying, predictive model of law.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"32124\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"ECON\",\"course\":\"360-2\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Investments\",\"description\":\"The goal of this course is to introduce students to the issues involved in forming a portfolio of securities.

In other words, how do readers determine what writers deserve their trust?  Every day we place our confidence in strangers who advise us on matters that range from the immediate (movies and restaurants) to the long-term (our money and our health).  Yet high-profile scandals; such as fraudulent reporting at the New York Times, remind us that we must not place our faith too casually.  In this course, we will examine the relationship between writers and their readers with an eye to understanding how the style, social context, and unspoken assumptions of a written work help inspire our confidence or elicit our disbelief in both the context of fiction and non-fiction.  Students will be asked to consider the ethical responsibilities both of readers, alert to the possibility of misrepresentation or fraud, and of writers seeking to establish their own credibility and authority.  <br/><br/>Course readings will include works of fiction, journalism, and writings from the natural and social sciences.

We will study the literary and cultural meanings of the prostitute, seeking to identify what precisely representing the prostitute on stage accomplished for both authors and audiences in early modern London.

We will be read examples of fabulism as writers read: to understand how these fictions are madestudying them from the inside out, so to speak.  Many of these genres overlap.  For instance they are all rooted in the tale, a kind of story that goes back to primitive sources.  They all speculate: they ask the question What If? They all are stories that demand invention, which, along with the word transformation, will be the key terms in the course.  The invention might be a monster, a method of time travel, an alien world, etc. but with rare exception the story will demand an invention and that invention will often also be the central image of the story.

This course surveys cross-cultural exchanges and dramatic conflicts between U.S. and Latin American poets in the &quot;Global Cold War&quot; (1945-1989). We often describe the Cold War as a political conflict between the competing universals of American democracy and Soviet communism, but the Cold War also re-oriented cultural relations between the U.S. and Latin America. How did poets from the U.S. and Cuba diverge in their reactions to (and participation in) the Cuban Revolution? How do Elizabeth Bishop's formalist poems of life in Brazil compare to those of her Brazilian contemporaries? Why did Beat poetry find a strong reception in Mexico City? How did Chilean poets write about the traumas of U.S.-backed interventions? Why did U.S. countercultures style themselves after &quot;revolutionary&quot; poets of Peru and El Salvador? Why did Borges, Paz and Neruda become sudden, global stars? We trace these questions through the history of &quot;late modernist&quot; poetry, Beat poetry, the Black Arts Movement, confessionalism, and formalism, putting these movements in dialogue with their cross-cultural doubles, such as conversacionalismo, concrete poetry, anti-poetry, &quot;guerilla&quot; poetry and negritude.

Two introductory weeks will be devoted to representations of vice and virtue in general; subsequently, one week will be devoted to each of the seven deadly sins, paired with its remediating virtue: pride/humility, envy/kindness, gluttony/temperance, lust/chastity, wrath/patience, greed/liberality, sloth/diligence. Texts will include both canonical and non-canonical writers drawn from various fields, including allegorical and iconographic painting (Lorenzetti, Bruegel, Bosch); narrative poetry (Skelton, Spenser, Milton); lyric poetry (Jonson, Donne); drama (Marlowe, Milton); prose sermons and conduct manuals (Castiglione, Donne, Browne, Aylett); and contemporary scholarship (Gill, Miller).

This raises a question: why, in the English Department's curriculum, do we consider it to be the critical watershed that separates literary modernity from the hoary past? In fact, although 1798 may be a relatively spare year, the decade of the 1790s is one of the most transformative in both literary and political terms in the Atlantic world. Beginning with the response to the French Revolution of 1789, the decade witnesses in Britain the heady days of radical social reform movements, followed by severe political reaction in the wake of the Terror.  In America, this is the first full decade of the nation's existence that culminates in the turbulence of the Alien and Sedition Acts and the so-called Jeffersonian revolution.  These years also witness the Haitian Revolution, the first successful slave rebellion in the Americas culminating in the establishment of the Republic of Haiti.  This is a decade of paradoxes, then, with some of the most strident assertions of human rights modeled on Enlightenment principles (Paine) giving rise to a distinctively modern political conservatism (Burke), even as there is a broad shift across the political spectrum from a republican to a liberal political discourse.  At the same time, mass-market genre fictions, including the Gothic, become dominant features of the literary landscape, and with Jane Austen, the realist novel will come to acquire its more settled and recognizable nineteenth-century form.<br/><br/>In this class, then, our purpose will be threefold. First, we will study the literature of the 1790s and the first decade of the 1800s, on both sides of the Atlantic, in order to track how various literary genres respond to and (hope to) shape the dramatic social changes of the moment. Second, we will ask a set of methodological questions about literary periodization and literary history. How do we define a literary period, either based on formal literary features or extrinsic politico-historical features? Is a single date adequate to capture the complex historical movements at work? What principles and ideological premises underlie the choice of a single date? Third, we will interrogate what it means to speak of a literary modernity, what features might characterize it, and whether modernity is a useful conceptual rubric to understand the changes at work in this period.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"32255\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"ENGLISH\",\"course\":\"353-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Studies in Romantic Literature\",\"description\":\"The event of the French Revolution is one of the formative experiences for Romantic poetry. The poets often imagine themselves to be responding to the revolution, either sympathetically or critically. At the level of literary form, the many innovative poetic projects of the period are often conceived in revolutionary terms, even when they have a complex relation to political revolution. Much romantic poetry hopes to achieve a far-reaching transformation of the psyche, in the way that the French revolution had transformed the political world. In this class, we will study a wide array of writers from the romantic period, through the lens of revolution. What is revolutionary about Romantic poetry, and how is it shaped by the historical experience of revolution? In what way are romantic writers responding to the advent of modernity? What is the relationship between literature and politics, both at the level of form and content? Does it make sense to think of Romanticism as the first of the modern literary avant-gardes?

Until very recently, these works have been considered central to the canon of modernist fiction and read as meditations on the tortured consciousness of the artist (TSATF, AILD, A,A! ) or the dilemma of the outsider adrift in an alienating world (LIA).  Saturating Faulkner's novels are images of the anguished history of race relations in the American South from the 19th century to the Great Migration and Great Depression.  Yet the tragic legacy of slavery, Faulkner's abiding subject, has been understood by critics as a figure for more abstract and universal moral predicaments.

In the world of film, there is little distance between the Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven.<br/><br/>This course is an intensive historical survey of two complementary genres: the Western and the jidaigeki (period dramas). We'll open the course by examining short silent films in these genres. After this introduction, we'll turn to films produced during and after World War II. In concert with our cinematic inquiry, we'll also look at literary texts. Some of these texts (such as Zeami's Chshingura) are direct source material for later film adaptations, but we'll also rely upon other texts to get a wider sense of the possibilities of the Western and jidaigeki genres. In addition to probing the concept of &quot;genre&quot; itself, we will also examine the problem of &quot;adaptation.&quot; How are elements present in one national, cinematic, or literary context transposed or re-coded to fit within another?

For much of the twentieth century, critics took the Parson at his word, imagining late medieval England as the site of a poetic battle between distinct alliterative and rhyming traditions. Indeed, they went farther than the Parson, portraying alliterative poetry as a self-consciously conservative movement that defined itself in opposition to the cosmopolitan and progressive rhyming verse of London and its environs. Deliberately harking back to Old English alliterative poetry, it was thought to constitute a nativist &quot;Alliterative Revival&quot; that fought unsuccessfully to expunge cosmopolitan influences from English literature. More recently, virtually every aspect of this narrative has been called into question. Alliterative poetry cannot have undergone a revival because it did not first disappear; it is not a regional poetry of the north and west; it is not isolated from other kinds of literary production; it does not eschew French and other continental borrowings; and its apparent resurgence in the second half of the fourteenth century can be attributed to a combination of wishful dating and the rising prestige of vernacular literature in general during that period. <br/><br/>In this course we will read a selection of the most important alliterative poems produced in England between 1350 and 1450 in order to decide for ourselves whether they can meaningfully be described as a poetic corpus, and what the characteristics of that corpus might be. What, besides alliteration, do alliterating poems have in common? Why is alliterative poetry so often anonymous and public, when rhymed poetry of the same period is increasingly attached to an author's name and a literary coterie? How and why does alliteration become a privileged vehicle for social analysis and social complaint? Why does there seem to be a correlation between alliteration and personification allegory? What attitude do alliterative poems adopt towards their own verse form? As we seek to characterize late medieval alliterating poetry we will also, inevitably, reconfigure the traditional canon of rhyming poetry. Instead of serving as the solitary &quot;well of English undefiled&quot; described by Spenser, Chaucer will be shown to react against, and compete with, an equally cosmopolitan but less courtly alliterative poetics.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"32267\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"ENGLISH\",\"course\":\"434-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Studies in Shakespeare &amp; the Early Drama\",\"description\":\"The seminar will serve as both a survey of English drama between 1580 and 1642 - to the extent that the immense output of Shakespeare's prolific contemporaries can be surveyed in one course - and an introduction to research and interpretive methods that have been used to study these plays.

Since a healthy biosphere is a diverse one, the class will examine the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning, methods used to slow the loss of biodiversity (i.e., how populations are harvested and how they are conserved), and examine the main driving force behind these changes - the recent population explosion and human beings.  The emergence of a single species (us) that undergoes a radical new kind of evolution (cultural) is modifying the biosphere at a rate so fast that biological adaptation cannot keep pace with the changes it causes; this fact is generating a costly and unnecessary mass extinction.<br/><br/>Pre-requisites: CHEM 103 or equivalent.

We will focus chiefly on ideas from <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em> that, since the book's publication in 1980, have &quot;gone viral,&quot; such as the concepts of the plateau, the rhizome, assemblage, deterritorialization, virtuality, the body without organs, becoming (becoming-woman, -animal, -minoritarian, -imperceptible, etc.), and nomadism.  Readings will include seminal essays by Fredric Jameson and Slavoj Zizek, who offer challenging responses to Deleuze and Guattari's landmark work, as well as interventions by Rosi Braidotti and Claire Colebrook, that consolidate and enlarge the stakes of the philosophical game.<br/><br/>In the last two weeks of the class, we will also consider two recent texts by Elizabeth Grosz and Jane Bennett, who respectively propose Deleuzian approaches to art and &quot;political ecology.&quot;\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"26301\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"FRENCH\",\"course\":\"498-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Independent Reading\",\"description\":\"Contact the department for further information\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"25980\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"FRENCH\",\"course\":\"596-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"PhD Thesis Tutorial\",\"description\":\"Contact the department for further information\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"32574\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"GBL_HLTH\",\"course\":\"303-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Gender and Global Health\",\"description\":\"This course will explore the relevance of biological &quot;sex&quot; and social &quot;gender&quot; to issues of health and healing around the world.

From the 1790s until the middle of the twentieth century, Western feminism fought on two fronts, condemning women's legal and political disenfranchisement as well as practices, like the wearing of corsets, that subordinated women at the level of everyday life.  GSS 231/ CLS 205 will explore feminism in America after the legal and political battle has, to some extent, been won.  We'll examine the so-called second wave of feminism, from the mid-1960s to the end of the 1970s.  This radical, widespread, and intimately critical phase of the feminist movement attacked inequity that persisted beyond women's nominal political and legal enfranchisement.  The second wave locates oppression in personal lifein intercourse, domestic labor, fashion, representation, art, family, and loveto assert that mainstream norms, habits, and assumptions operate just as powerfully as repressive laws.  Because much second-wave feminist argument exists in the forms of physical activism, cultural interventions, and artistic production, we will encounter a variety of media:  academic prose, but also manifestos, journalism, film, visual art, video art, novels, and performances.  At the same time that we track the historical roots and articulations of this feminist movement, an ongoing goal of the class will be to investigate the critical methods pioneered by the second wave.  What analytic tools does second-wave feminism use to criticize culture?

Relatedly, we will explore how those subjectified by this knowledge used science to demand social recognition and legal rights, and how they also challenged and contributed to the production of sexual science by insisting on the validity and value of their experience. We will further consider the curious and ambivalent standpoint of scientific `experts' themselves, many of whom were enthusiastic yet conflicted participants in movements for sex reform and homosexual rights.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"31742\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"GNDR_ST\",\"course\":\"331-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Sociology of Gender and Sexuality\",\"description\":\"Scholars have given considerable attention to the myriad ways that race, class, ethnicity, and gender have shaped urban life; however, the influence of sexuality - sexual orientation more specifically -has been largely ignored. This course focuses on the oft-ignored dimension of sexuality and how it physically and culturally shapes cities and city life. Drawing on a variety of readings from urban geography, feminist and queer studies, social history, and sociology, we will examine the features of urbanism that made the creation of non-normative sexual identities possible, the forms of sexual identities that emerged, the formation and development of urban communities mobilized around these sexual identities, and the transformation of American city life enabled through the increased visibility and participation of these sexual communities.  Topics covered include: slumming excursions at the turn of the 20th century; sexuality and the American Community; the rise and fall (?) of gay and lesbian neighborhoods; urban nightlife as strategies for urban renewal; and sexual citizenship and urban space.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"21987\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"GNDR_ST\",\"course\":\"332-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Gender, Sexuality, and Health\",\"description\":\"In this course we begin with an examination of two contemporary controversies in the United States (the &quot;epidemic&quot; of obesity and the debate over the HPV vaccine) in order to consider what constitutes a public health crisis in the context of broader transnational debates about health and &quot;risk.&quot; We will consider the origins of &quot;public health&quot; as a concept and the institutions and practices that grew up around this concept in the 19th and 20th centuries, both in European and American cities and as part of colonial projects.

Imagine &quot;woman&quot;: is this a coherent and stable category, born of a shared condition and common standpoint? Or is it a fictitious unity that disintegrates once inflected with the differences of first, second, and third &quot;worlds,&quot; and the diversities that mark race, ethnicity, nationality, and class? Consider &quot;sexuality&quot;: does the notion of &quot;woman&quot; as a subject paradoxically undercut feminist goals by reaffirming the &quot;heterosexual matrix&quot; instead of disrupting it?  If so, and &quot;woman&quot; has meaning only in heterosexual, male-dominated, systems of thought, then should we conclude that lesbians are not women? What of &quot;gender&quot;? Is it the cultural construction of pregiven (m/f) sexed body? Or are sex and the sexed body themselves conjured so as to prop up an artificially &quot;natural&quot; binary relation that legitimates the subjugation of female to male and women to men? In that case, if &quot;gender&quot; has meaning only as a harsh imposition to rob women of what belongs to them by right, then must gender be destroyed? Or might we instead think of gender not as a system of domination but as &quot;performative&quot; - as the various ways in which a body shows or produces its cultural signification within and against the restricting frames of compulsory heterosexuality? Yet if feminism takes that risk toward the performative, rejecting the idea of a &quot;doer&quot; behind the deed, then must it also wager away that feminist &quot;we&quot; (woman/women) at the heart of a feminist politics? Imagine there's no such thing as women. Then what? These are only some of the many contentious questions that trouble feminist theory today.

This introductory lecture course is designed to help students understand the relatively recent origins of many of these problems, focusing especially on the last one hundred and fifty years. Students will have an opportunity to learn about the environmental effects of urbanization, industrialization, population growth, market economies, empire-building, intercontinental warfare, energy extraction, and new technologies. They will also explore different environmental philosophies and analytic frameworks that help us make sense of historical change, including political ecology, environmental history, science studies, and world history.

According to some, it secularized irrational and corrupt popular beliefs and offered a more personal and spiritual religious experience. According to others it re-channeled the fruits of a deep medieval religiosity that spilled over into all aspects of human life, berthing a new moral and worldly sensibility that provided the foundations for capitalist development and social revolution. Despite these often diametrically opposed interpretations (and others), the Reformation simultaneously involved continuity and innovation. The Reformation cast a long shadow back to important religious, political, and social reforms and conditions in the later Middle Ages, and it continued to be enlisted in defining political systems and religious sensibilities well into Modernity. There were many different reformations in the long sixteenth century, stretching from the mid fifteenth to the mid seventeenth centuriesbased on geography, denomination, social standing, and personal orientation. In this course, we explore the early foundations of the European reformations of the sixteenth century, their full expression across Europe, and their lasting impact in European and world history.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"31484\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"HISTORY\",\"course\":\"311-0\",\"section\":\"01\",\"title\":\"The New Nation: The United States; 1787-1848\",\"description\":\"In this course we will explore the dramatic transformation of the early United States.  Its Constitution freshly in hand, the nation began as a small and precariously situated presence in eastern North America; by 1848, it had emerged as a transcontinental nation with booming transportation networks, a skyrocketing population, and sprawling financial markets.  In the North, wage labor reshaped urban and rural communities alike; in the South, planters forcibly crafted the wealthiest slave society in the entire world.  Struggling to make sense of these changes, people turned to religion like never before; struggling to manage the changes, they turned to politics, debating the balance between state and federal government, relations with native people, the government's role in economic development, and the future of slavery.

In fact, Americans have always defined themselves and their nation through the material things they make, own, and use.  This class examines the 250-year debate over what America is and ought to be by studying its material artifacts, the changing ways they have been made and sold, and the meanings Americans have ascribed to them.  From the pony express to social media, from the scrubboard to the washing machine, from the bicycle to the Apollo missions, Americans have identified technology as central to their personal and national destiny.  What have some Americans meant by technological progress, and why have other Americans been so suspicious of it?  How have state regulations and intellectual property law shaped technological development?  We will consider the views of engineers, factory workers, slaves, housewives, managers, intellectuals, consumers, and hackers.  And we will develop a set of tools for analyzing technological change: evolutionary theory, systems theory, network analysis, social constructionism, and technological determinism.

How has the role of intellectuals changed with the growth of the university, the rise of the planners, and the emergence of novel sources of information? Such questions will be explored as we read a variety of primary texts from the period and scholarship in the field of intellectual history.

By the mid-sixteenth century the Spanish crown famously reigned over an empire `in which the sun never set', controlling not only the Iberian Peninsula, but also the Netherlands, large parts of Italy, overseas possessions in the Americas and Asia and holding the German Imperial Crown. It was also one of the most vibrant European societies and economies. After 1640 Spain successively lost its European possessions and receded into the periphery of European intellectual and social life while its economy entered a prolonged phase of stagnation, although it continued to control its Latin American colonies.<BR/><br/><BR/><br/>The course starts out by examining the genesis of peninsular Spain into a union of reigns and peoples loosely integrated under a common monarchy. It looks at the diverse religious (Muslim, Jewish, Christian) and linguistic origins that shaped Spanish society, as well as the contrast between urban and rural worlds and the urban rebellion of the comuneros of the early 16th century. It examines the origins and consequences of renewed social control in the 16th century in the form of the famous Spanish Inquisition and asks if religious and political attempts at `unifying' Spanish society and economy were successful. <BR/><br/><BR/><br/>The program then turns to comparing the peninsular Spanish experience to that of the Dutch, Italian, Portuguese and German subjects of the Spanish crown and investigates the origins of the revolts that eventually led in some cases to their departure from common rule. It also seeks to understand how the `discovery' of the Americas made Europeans on their own society. By examining the diversity and the unifying elements of the Hispanic experience in the light of its other possessions the course offers an overview of one of the most important European players of the early modern period.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"22433\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"HISTORY\",\"course\":\"345-2\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"History of Russia, 1700-1917\",\"description\":\"This will be a course about what happened to Russia after it became a major European power in the early 18th century.

But in forcing through those changes, the Russian government became more autocratic than it ever had been before, and introduced a fatal division between the Europeanized elite and the mass of peasantry, who lived in a traditional cultural world.

An overarching development during this period was the creation of an industrialized political economy based on the systematic denial of civil and political rights on the basis of race.  But rather than view ordinary South Africans as passive victims, we will explore how their efforts to resist, subvert, and alter those developments were major forces in shaping modern South Africa.

It seeks to achieve three main goals. First, students will gain an historical understanding of Latino electoral politics. These days, every election cycle we hear more and more about the efforts of liberals and conservatives alike to woo Latino voters. In fact, political commentators now say that no candidate can become President without capturing 35 percent of the Latino vote. To demonstrate their point, they note that George W. Bush barely won this percentage in 2000, but then won 44 percent of the Latino vote in 2004, which helped explain his greater margin of victory over John Kerry than Al Gore. The wrangling over the Latino vote that seems pivotal today, in fact, has characterized American politics for more than a century. Second, beyond national electoral politics, students will come to understand why a significant percentage of Latinos have identified as conservatives. Many observers have cited their conservative social, cultural, and religious views, but this course also will consider economics and ethnic identity. Because conservatives tend to advocate harsher positions on immigration and other issues, most Latinos identify as liberals. Many liberal Latinos even think of their conservative co-ethnics as &quot;sell outs,&quot; because they've chosen to support candidates who haven't supported them. Third, although this course will focus on Latino Conservatives, students will explore ethnic conservatism more broadly by comparing Latino Conservatives with their African American, Asian American, and Native American counterparts. This issue has divided families, communities, and the United States in general for more than a century.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"31690\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"HISTORY\",\"course\":\"392-0\",\"section\":\"22\",\"title\":\"Topics In History\",\"description\":\"From the industrial revolution to the establishment of major urban spaces to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the natural environment has undergone profound changes ever the past 250 years.

Broadly speaking, environmental history examines interactions between humans and their environments; culture and nature; technology and the land. We'll interrogate these dichotomies from a historical perspective to see how notions of science, progress, nature, and sustainability have shaped our understanding of the land and ourselves. Since this is a vast field, we will take a topical approach and focus on especially relevant themes, such as water, animals and wilderness, frontiers, catastrophes, cities, and food.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"31693\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"HISTORY\",\"course\":\"392-0\",\"section\":\"23\",\"title\":\"Topics In History\",\"description\":\"Science is often portrayed as a higher calling, one that is insulated from the demands of the marketplace.  Yet scientists have always been entrepreneurs, actively marketing and sometimes even directly profiting from their discoveries and inventions.  Why, then, do we take it for granted that business professionals act in their own self-interest while we are outraged to learn that a study on climate change was commissioned by the oil industry or that an important medical trial was bankrolled by a pharmaceutical company?  This course will explore the vexed but longstanding relationship between science and commerce from the 17th century to our own.   In so doing, we will ask when the modern notion of science as a disinterested pursuit of objective truth took root in the first place.  We will also explore how our knowledge of the natural world has been shaped by personal, financial, and other kinds of self-interest in a number of diverse contexts.  These will range from Galileo's invention of the telescope in Renaissance Italy to geologists who consulted for the mineral industry on America's 19th century western frontier to the patenting of genetically engineered organisms in today's globalized world.

We will look at similarities, differences, and commonalities between the modes of participation of women in Mexico, Cuba, and Nicaragua, among other case studies. Students will first become familiarized with the histories of each of these Revolutions and their respective political contexts, and then subsequently focus on the participation of women within those revolutions.

Our main objective is to understand how the facts of inequality have been used to create widely varying historical interpretations of inequality, many of which have had very significant political and social impacts.

It is also, and perhaps more importantly, a unique method for probing the relationship between memory and history, the connection between the individual and the collective, and the nature of subjectivity. It is an intensely dynamic and interactive process in which the oral history interview itself is the creation of a primary source, the taped interview and interview transcript. This in turn brings together issues of subjectivity, memory, narrative, representation, and the very nature of evidence, among others. The creation, analysis, interpretation, and use of these primary sources is the focus of this course. We will examine methods and theories for oral history, from the nitty-gritty such as prepping for and conducting oral history interviews, to the broad and general, such as framing research questions and analyzing oral histories, to the legal and ethical issues involved in interviewing narrators, including the recent IRB controversy.  We will discuss the uses of oral history for a variety of presentation formats, such as monographs, documentaries, and exhibits, and evaluate several distinct research projects that make extensive use of oral history.

At any given moment, how many alternatives are possible?   Is there really such a thing as chance or<br/>choice?   On what basis do we choose?  How do students select a college, and how does a college decide which students to select or fund?   Professor Morson, a specialist in literature, and Professor Schapiro, a labor economist specializing in the economics of higher education, will themselves offer alternative approaches to these questions based on the presuppositions of their respective disciplines.

Home to the emperor for over a thousand years, Kyoto was the setting for the world's first novel, the birthplace of the theatrical forms noh and kabuki, and the center of Japan's nascent movie industry in the twentieth century. Now, it is widely known as a tourist destination, a place where foreigners can find the &quot;real&quot; Japan of temples, geisha, mountains, and cherry blossoms. This courses focuses on key eras in Kyoto's history - the flourishing of aristocratic culture during the Heian period (794-1185), the catastrophe of the Onin War (1467-77), the tumultuous period of the Meiji Restoration (1868), and the present day. To investigate the history of the city as well as the cultural production surrounding it, we will read ancient poetry, the &quot;pillow book&quot; of an aristocratic lady, a samurai war tale, and excerpts from manga. We will also view movies about the city in these periods. Throughout, we will attempt to answer the question: What makes a city &quot;Japanese,&quot; &quot;traditional,&quot; and &quot;beautiful,&quot; and how do the meanings of these ideas change over time? No background in Japanese language or history is required.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"21907\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"HUM\",\"course\":\"302-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"New Perspectives in the Humanities\",\"description\":\"Shanghai: Paris of the East, Paradise of Adventurers, Birthplace of the Chinese Communist Party, City of Migrants, Linong (alley way) City, Refugee City, Island Shanghai, China's Industrial City, Open Port.

This course will engage with the ways in which scholars have looked at the causes of such migrations. These may be economic (related to the global south-north divide, free trade agreements, international labor market, etc.) cultural (associated with racial, ethnic, class, gender, and religious tensions), and political (resulting from post-colonial migration, state building, and development projects). The class will also analyze the outcomes of specific experiences of Diaspora, such as challenges to modern cultural, political, and social categories, the redefinition of international security laws, the construction of transnational communities and cultures, and the implementation of immigration policies intended to regulate the lives of Diasporic groups.

His creative <em>oeuvre</em> expresses the exhilaration, anxiety, compromises, creativity, openness, and craftsmanship characteristic of the transition. Calvino at the start of his career resisted the appeal of literary realism and Neo-realism and sought to inaugurate an idiosyncratic, new genre of fantastic fiction in works such as <em>The Baron in the Trees</em> and <em>Cosmicomics.</em>  He then became a member of the international literary group known as Oulipo, whose members were interested in affirming the conception of a literature as a game.  From the 1970s onward, his playful conception of literature pushed him toward new kinds of literary experimentations and philosophical meditations that find beautiful expressions in <em>Invisible Cities, Mr. Palomar,</em> and the &quot;hypernovel&quot; <em>If on a Winter's Night a Traveler. </em>  What are the advantages and the limits of Calvino's amusing land creative corpus?

It was discovered - some would say created - by people. Many of them led rich and interesting lives, which are surprisingly well documented. Most mathematicians know and enjoy the legends about the great names from the past and present - for example Archimedes in the bath and Galois writing down his great discoveries the night before he died in a duel. Knowing something about the people who created it adds an extra dimension to the mathematics. The aim of this seminar is for you to explore and enjoy this legacy. At each class meeting we will discuss one or two mathematicians. Members of the class research the topic in advance so that they can present it to the class. The rest of us will be expected to be a lively and interactive audience. Let me make it clear that this is not a calculus course in disguise.

How do institutions and laws differ among democratic countries and how do these differences affect political competition?  What about other variables such as ethnic divisions, nationalist fervor and international intervention, and how do these affect the development of political institutions in democracies?   The study of comparative politics addresses these and other questions and is about analyzing differences and similarities among the political, social and economic features of countries and determining how and why these differences matter. <br/><br/>Objectives: This class introduces methods and topics of comparative politics.  The first section of the course provides a brief survey of the comparative method and comparisons of regime types (sociologist Max Weber's three typespatrimonial, legal-rational and charismatic).  The second section narrows the focus to a comparison of the institutions and political behavior in democratic countries  This section provides conceptual building blocks for studying institutions, including voting systems, legislatures, executive institutions, political parties and constitutional design.  The third section takes a closer look at how political and social contexts shape new institutions in countries that are undergoing democratic transitions.  This section is considers a provocative argument that certain institutional designs and circumstances during the democratization process can promote conflicts.  The lectures for this section will make mention of the implications of this thesis for institutional design in contemporary cases such as Libya, Syria and Afghanistan. The final section returns to Weber's broader categories to consider an example of a patrimonial authority.  This section examines how personalist dictatorships work.  This case raises interesting questions about how to manage transitions of these political systems.<br/><br/>The overall theme of this course is that formal institutional rules of politics matter a great deal.   But new rules of politics in countries that suffer serious ethnic tensions or are exceptionally weak in their internal capabilities (so-called failing states) can produce unintended outcomes that may even be contrary to the intent of their designers.  What sorts of institutional designs are effective for state building?  This issue ought to be of special importance to students interested in such endeavors, whether in the world of activism, as a scholar or as a taxpayer and voter.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"21771\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"POLI_SCI\",\"course\":\"302-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Early Modern Political Thought\",\"description\":\"This course examines some of the most important texts in early modern political thought.

There are many ways of thinking about how the literature hinges together or how debates in international relations are conducted. Who is reacting to whom? What are the first premises that undergird various theories? How are theories influenced by fundamental ontological and epistemological assumptions?<br/><br/>1. One way of organizing the literature is to distinguish between various research paradigms such as Realism, Liberalism, Constructivism and Post-Modernism. The first three arguably share the quest for causal regularities while Post Modern or Post Structural approaches do not. They differ on key epistemological and methodological issues. <br/><br/>2. Yet another way is to compare different approaches by focusing on dependent variables or &quot;empirical puzzles.&quot; This leads to a comparative assessment of the merits of the various approaches as I have tended to follow in my own work. This is admittedly an empiricist approach to the field. One deploys Large N, or comparative case methods to analyze various contending theories. <br/><br/>3. In addition, within shared research programs, one might distinguish different levels of analysis; measurement of variables; qualitative vs. quantitative approaches, and so on. For example, realists might differ on whether to use first level analysis (Jervis) or third level (Waltz). But both arguably share the same realist paradigm in many respects.<br/><br/>How one ends up thinking about the literature will depend on how you evaluate the merits of the various arguments. Some of this will also depend on your own personal disposition. Do you see political science as a science? Etc.

For over two thousand years people have considered the Hebrew Bible - a rich assortment of stories, laws, hymns, prophesies, prayers, and more - to be a source of religious, artistic, and psychological inspiration. The Bible has profoundly shaped and still does shape the ways in which we think about the world, about ourselves, about the relations between humans and God, about literature, about history, and of course, about religion. Regardless of whether we are believers or not, and regardless of the religion with which are affiliated or not, we all live in a world in which this book and the history of its interpretation are still one of the most formative powers. </p><br/><p>The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the richness and diversity of the Hebrew Bible, with special emphasis on the many different voices, genres, positions, opinions, and mindsets that we find in the various biblical texts. The orientation of the course is academic and not devotional, and our learning process will be guided by the assumption that the Hebrew Bible consists of many different works, composed at different times and in different historical circumstances, and which voice different ideas and concerns. </p><br/><p>While the course is structured more or less according to the order of the books in the Bible, which itself more or less corresponds to the biblical history of the world, this course is not a simple survey of biblical books or biblical history, which can be found in multiple other sources. Rather, this course suggests different ways and strategies for reading and interpreting the Bible. Our focus will be on discovering the many angles and perspectives from which the Bible can be approached, and on developing our own skills and sensitivities as readers of the Bible.</p>\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"22706\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"RELIGION\",\"course\":\"319-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Topics in Buddhism\",\"description\":\"East Asian Religious Classics This course will examine a number of texts that represent some of the most important and influential philosophical traditions and religious systems in East Asia.

In this course we will attempt to investigate the meaning of the concept &quot;Jewish&quot; through a study of the Jewish &quot;body&quot; in the course of the 20th  century, first in Europe and then in the State of Israel. <br/><br/>The first part of the course will focus on changes in the status of Jews in Europe at the end of the 19th and especially the beginning of the 20th century. The Jew was understood then as a person without honor, who therefore could not be included in the elite of European society. The Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment movement) and Zionism attempted to restore Jews to the honor discourse (e.g. in Theodore Herzl's The New Ghetto). The Haskalah demanded that Jews be granted equal rights and status to others in Europe, while Zionism aspired to the creation of a new Jew, with honor, in Eretz Yisrael (the &quot;Land of Israel&quot;). <br/><br/>For many, the perception of the Jewish body as insignificant was proof that Jews lacked honor. The attempt to create a Muskeljudentum (&quot;muscular Judaism&quot;), to use the term of Max Nordau, a Jew who was capable of working the land and bearing arms, was one of the responses to the prevalent perception. Through readings from contemporary literary sources, this part of the course will examine this and other responses, and ask to what extent they succeeded. We will, inter alia, look at Ultra Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish stances concerning the formation of a new Jewish body. <br/><br/>In the second part of the course we will move to Palestine of the 1930's, and to the State of Israel in the 50's. We will focus on the Zionist body in Eretz Yisrael (Berdyczewski, Brenner), and its encounter with the bodies of Jews who survived the horrors of the Holocaust (Aharon Appelfeld), the death camps and the extermination attempts, all of which had as their aim the annihilation of the Jewish body.<br/><br/>The third part of the course will study images of the body in the State of Israel, from the middle of the 20th until the first decade of the 21st century, principally through investigations of the image of the body in Israeli cinema and law. We will examine the image of the &quot;soldier body&quot;, the religious body, the female body, the homosexual body and the Palestinian body.  This part of the course will pivot around the current critique in Israel concerning the normative Zionist narrative, and the ways in which - over time - the body in this narrative is deconstructed, as different bodies emerge to reconstruct narratives that are new and distinct.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"32492\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"RELIGION\",\"course\":\"349-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Topics in Christianity\",\"description\":\"<b>Christian Theology from the Other Side: Liberation and Contextual Theologies in the Americas, 1960-2012</b><br/><br/>In this course, we will explore the viewpoints of diverse Christian theologians from underrepresented populations throughout the Americas.

Additional topics, based on student interest, may include the theological viewpoints of Latinas, Asian-American men and women, gay men, and lesbian women.

We will use the writings of historians, sociologists, anthropologists, and religious studies scholars to explore how evangelicals experience God in their everyday lives, to analyze their involvement in American politics, and to understand their attitudes toward gender roles, sexuality, race and social justice. Previous coursework in religious studies, sociology, anthropology or American history is recommended, though not required.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"21430\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"RELIGION\",\"course\":\"371-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Religion and Film\",\"description\":\"A few years after its 1987 release, the Danish film Babette's Feast became established as a classic food movie. Its rich textural body, which embraces the extremes of food representation, investigates the correlation of food to spiritual practicewilled or unwilled starvation; charity; commerce; abundance; communion; and celebration, the secular sacred. Entwined in the film's layered discourse on religion as hostile, indifferent, or friendly to human creatures lies a central question: in what ways does the presence of food in a film signal aspects of the social, cultural, historical, political, gendered, racially fraught fabric of our lives?<br/><br/>In this course, we will explore extremes of food representation, beginning with Babette's Feast and Diary of a Country Priest (1951), where destruction wars with grace within a parish and its inhabitants. Expect rigorous dissection of the social and spiritual vectors of food in Mostly Martha (Germany); He Who Must Die (France); Siberia, Monamour (France; Russia); Gran Torino (U.S.); The Boy With a Bike (Belgium); Le Havre (Finland); A Separation (Iran); Elena (Russia); and others from film cultures around the world.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"22556\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"RELIGION\",\"course\":\"374-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Contemporary Religious Thought\",\"description\":\"<b>Science and Religion</b><br/><br/>This course examines the topic from many angles.

In this course we will read about and discuss religious bodies in different cultural contexts, as well as study different theories about embodiment.  Our starting point will be a founding &quot;father&quot; of religious studies, Emile Durkheim.  Beginning with Durkheim's notion of collective effervescence as central to community formation and to religion, we will discuss bodies and embodiment in ways that push beyond &quot;mind-body&quot; dualism.  Our task is greater than acknowledging the simple and indisputable reminder that humans have objectified bodies in many different ways.  Rather, theories of embodiment complicate the very notion of an actor having a body in the first place.  The sentence &quot;I have a body&quot; positions me as conscious subject reflecting on body as object.  <br/> <br/>Although we will read some theoretical approaches to the study of bodies/embodiment, our primary task will be to attempt to sneak up on bodies in action by reading ethnographic and historical accounts of humans in motion.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"21107\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"RELIGION\",\"course\":\"396-2\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Senior Seminar\",\"description\":\"This seminar is designed to enable students who have taken 396-1 to expand and revise research begun in the Fall Quarter in order to write the senior thesis.

As of the 1990s, however, an approach that casts serious doubts on the value and viability of the comparative study of religion has become more and more prominent in the field, making the claim that the underlying premises of the comparative enterprise are essentialistic, ahistorical, simplistic, and reductive. <br/><br/>Is there a way to employ a comparative perspective in religion without falling into traps of overarching claims about &quot;human nature,&quot; &quot;spiritual experience,&quot; or &quot;psychic structures?&quot; Can we derive important insights on the traditions in which we specialize from exposure to other traditions? How can we maintain a highly historical and contextual view of religious phenomena while still noting commonalities across times and cultures? These questions will stand at the center of this seminar, and will be explored though one particular theme - death and dying in religious traditions.<br/><br/>The centrality of death in almost every form of religious culture - whether in practices of burial and mourning, in notions about mortality and after life, or in the presence of the dead in the sphere of the living - makes this theme a particularly fecund site through which to consider the potential value, as well as pitfalls, of a comparative perspective in the study of religion. Throughout the class we will read eminent studies of various death-related phenomena, from concepts of afterlife to the production and use of relics, from mourning ritual for aborted fetuses to cannibalistic practices, and venture to see how different studies of different religious cultures can illuminate each other, and edify our own engagement with the tradition in which each of us specialize.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"26663\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"RELIGION\",\"course\":\"490-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Independent

The main topic of the course is the theory and practice of linear regression analysis. We will cover multiple ordinary least squares regression, regression assumptions, regression diagnostics, basic path models, data transformations, and issues in causal inference.  The course will also include discussion of practical issues in performing a statistical analysis of secondary data.  This includes where to find existing data, reading data into statistical packages, and practical issues in computing to do statistical analysis.  We will use Stata for computer-based statistical analysis.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"21617\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"SOCIOL\",\"course\":\"403-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Field Methods\",\"description\":\"The problem with learning to do fieldwork is that you need to learn everything all at once.  Fieldwork defies compartmentalization or much setting of priorities.  For the most part, people learn to do fieldwork rather than being taught to do it.  On the theory that learning to do fieldwork is more a matter of being socialized rather than of learning techniques, the course is arranged to provide a concentrated exposure to fieldwork.  Through your own and your colleagues' field experiences and five quite different books by fieldworkers, you will be exposed to a wide variety of field settings.  These monographs and your own experiences will also provide us with a common base to draw on in reflecting on the methodological and ethical issues addressed in the pieces on how to do fieldwork and ethnographic writing.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"32218\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"SOCIOL\",\"course\":\"420-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Cultural Sociology and the Sociology of Culture\",\"description\":\"This course introduces graduate students to the sociology of culture (understanding social influence on cultural formations) and cultural sociology (understanding cultural influences on social processes).

Hence, urban ethnography - the systematic observation of city life - has a long history in sociology.  In this class, we will chart various concepts and topics that have interested urban ethnographers over time, including ethnic and racial integration and segmentation, family formation and stability, crime and violence, work and labor stratification, and political organizing and activism. We will read classic and contemporary ethnographies to analyze if the method has changed over time. We will attend to issues of ethics, representation and politics in the doing of urban ethnography. And we will discuss the dialogue between urban ethnography and other sociological methods in various fields. The emphasis will be on monograph-length ethnographies, although we will read some journal articles as models for how to publish in that format.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"33434\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"SOCIOL\",\"course\":\"476-0\",\"section\":\"22\",\"title\":\"Topics in Sociological Analysis\",\"description\":\"This seminar offers a broad overview of different theoretical and empirical approaches within historically and comparatively-oriented political sociology and political science.  We begin by surveying some of the grand themes of historical political sociology and political science of the 1970s and 1980s - collective action, revolutions, state formation, war and policymaking, then investigate contemporary rethinking of these themes and the emergence of new perspectives and topics, including agency, power in its &quot;productive&quot; mode, identities, religion, &quot;race&quot; and nations, gender and sexualities, culture.  By the end of the seminar, students will have an appreciation of the development of comparative and historical approaches within sociology and political science, and will understand some the key animating questions that have shaped research in the subfield.\"}", "{\"uniqueID\":\"21366\",\"term\":\"4490\",\"school\":\"WCAS\",\"subject\":\"SOCIOL\",\"course\":\"480-0\",\"section\":\"20\",\"title\":\"Introduction to the Discipline\",\"description\":\"Introduction to the department, faculty, and adjunct faculty.

Fifty years later, Cuba, the Revolution, and its enigmatic leader continue to be the subject of intense debate.  In this course, we will look at how the Revolution has been portrayed by Cubans themselves.  We will read a diverse array of texts - political speeches, short stories, scholarly essays, novels, and selectionsfrom contemporary blogs - in an attempt to understand how Cuban writers and directors have addressed questions of political engagement, national identity, and the place of art in the Revolution.  We will also watch a number of films to see how Cuban cinema has explored these issues in visual and well as narrative terms.

Moving to the French Caribbean, we will analyze the articulation of Négritude in Aimé Césaire's Cahier d'un retour au pays natal and will trace the &quot;dialogue&quot; established between his work and that of Surrealist writers André Breton and Pierre Mabille.
